# Introduction

I've been a happy user of [the itunes API
project](https://github.com/maddox/itunes-api) but had the idea for a
web-app front end that would do some of the stuff I like at my house. 

(See [this repo](https://github.com/phubbard/dash-play) for using Amazon
Dash buttons to control the iTunes API)

This project is just that, using jQuery and Bootstrap to make a single-page
app that front-ends the API.

#  Status

* All of the URLs and such are hardwired.
* Album art is semi-working; the cachebusting isn't working
* Working on the dropdown menus adding checkboxes for airplay devices
